# LSTM-nlp
The LSTM_nlp_text_generator.ipynb can just be run as is.
A requirements.txt file is included to set up a suitable environment.
After the model-construction and training bits there is a model-loading cell, so if you're so inclined you can skip ahead 
(though early on there are some imports you're still going to need)
The temperature parameter determines how much the model is allowed to diverge from the original model prediction, add a bit of mystery to your life
